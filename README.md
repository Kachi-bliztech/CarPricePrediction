<h1>Used Car Price Prediction</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the selling price of used cars based on various attributes such as brand, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. The objective is to assist both sellers and buyers in making data-driven decisions in the used car marketplace.

Problem Statement:
The goal is to predict the resale value of used cars by identifying patterns within a dataset containing multiple features. Accurately forecasting car prices can help dealerships, individual sellers, and online platforms improve pricing strategies, enhance customer trust, and optimize profitability.

Model Approach:
- </b>Collected and explored a dataset comprising historical data on used cars, including features such as brand, model, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, and selling price.</b>
- </b>Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing: a.Handled missing values and outliers b.Performed encoding of categorical variables c.Scaled numerical features</b>
- </b>Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover feature relationships and correlations with car prices</b>

Built and tested  machine learning model: </b>
- </b>Linear and lasso Regression model</b>
- </b>Evaluated model performance using metrics </b>



<h2>Skills </h2>

- </b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</b>
- </b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b>
- </b>Linear and lasso Regression model</b>
- </b>Feature engineering</b>
- </b>Model evaluation and interpretation</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>Successfully developed a machine learning model capable of predicting used car prices with high accuracy. This model provides a valuable tool for enhancing pricing transparency and optimizing business operations in the automotive resale market.</b>
